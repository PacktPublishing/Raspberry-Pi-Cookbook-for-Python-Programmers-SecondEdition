This is the code repository for [Raspberry Pi Cookbook for Python Programmers - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/raspberry-pi-cookbook-python-programmers-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785288326), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
network={ 
ssid="theSSID" 
key_mgmt=NONE 
}
```

This book focuses on using the Raspberry Pi with Python 3; therefore, a basic Raspberry 
Pi setup is required. Chapters 1 to 5 of this book make use of the Raspberry Pi only; no 
additional hardware is required beyond a standard setup. 

The standard setup will consist of a Raspberry Pi (Model A or Model B, Version 1, 2 or 3); an 
SD card installed with Raspbian; a suitable micro USB power supply; and an HDMI-compatible 
screen, keyboard, and mouse. You will also be required to download and install various 
software packages; therefore, the Raspberry Pi should have a working internet connection.
